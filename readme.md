# CrewAI Financial Trends Newsletter Automation

This project leverages the CrewAI framework to orchestrate a team of autonomous AI agents that work together to research, write, and proofread a newsletter about the latest trends in financial technology. It uses the Groq API for fast inference on a Groq-compatible LLM and includes custom tools (e.g., Google search via SerperDevTool) to enhance agent capabilities.

---

## Features

- **Multi-Agent Orchestration:**  
  - **Researcher Agent:** Identifies emerging trends in artificial intelligence in finance.
  - **Writer Agent:** Crafts an engaging article based on research findings.
  - **Proofreader Agent:** Polishes and validates the final report, ensuring clarity and accuracy.
  
- **Tool Integration:**  
  - Utilizes [SerperDevTool](https://console.groq.com/docs/crewai) for web searches to gather up-to-date information.
  
- **High-Speed Inference:**  
  - Powered by Groq’s API using a Groq-compatible model (e.g., `groq/llama3-70b-8192`).

- **Rate Limit Awareness:**  
  - Implements safeguards to handle Groq API rate limits, ensuring that long prompts or high token usage are managed gracefully.

---

## Prerequisites

- **Python Version:** Python ≥3.10 and <3.13
- **API Keys:**  
  - Groq API key (set as `GROQ_API_KEY` in your environment)  
  - (Optional) Other tool API keys (e.g., SERPER_API_KEY for SerperDevTool)

---

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/daniyal077/News-AI-Agent-.git
   cd News-AI-Agent-
   ```

2. **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment:**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  
   ```

3. **Install Required Packages:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set Up Environment Variables:**

   Create a `.env` file in the project root and add your API keys:

   ```env
   GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
   SERPER_API_KEY=your_serper_api_key_here
   ```

## Project Structure

```
yourproject/
├── agents.py       # Defines all agents (Researcher, Writer, Proofreader)
├── tasks.py        # Defines tasks corresponding to each agent
├── tools.py        # Initializes tools (e.g., SerperDevTool)
├── crew.py         # Assembles agents and tasks into a Crew and kicks off execution
├── app.py          # Streamlit app
├── .env            # Environment variables (API keys, etc.)
└── README.md       # Project documentation (this file)
```

---

## Usage

Run the project using the command:

```bash
python app.py
```

This command initializes the crew, which executes the following steps sequentially:

1. **Research Task:** Gathers information on emerging financial trends.
2. **Write Task:** Generates a four-paragraph article in markdown format.
3. **Proofread Task:** Finalizes the article, ensuring it’s well-structured and includes proper source citations.

## Troubleshooting

- **Rate Limit Errors:**  
  If you encounter a `RateLimitError` from Groq (e.g., exceeding tokens per minute), consider:
  - Reducing `max_tokens` or the length of prompts.
  - Implementing retry logic or delaying subsequent requests.
  - Upgrading your Groq service tier if high throughput is needed.

- **Environment Issues:**  
  Ensure that your `.env` file is correctly loaded and contains valid API keys.

For more information on Groq rate limits, refer to the [Groq API documentation](https://console.groq.com/docs/rate-limits).
